1. Wait for a Connection

    This system operates as a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, so both users need to be online and waiting to establish a connection.

2. Understanding Your User ID

    Every user is identified by a unique User ID.
    By default, the User ID is a hash generated from your display name. When you add a password (optional), itâ€™s hashed along with the display name to create an even more unique ID.
    Sharing the entire User ID, including the "user-" prefix, is essential for connection.
    Example: user-5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

3. Creating a Unique ID

    Your display name alone will generate a default hash-based ID.
    Adding a password customizes your ID further by hashing the display name with the password. This adds uniqueness, especially helpful if multiple users share similar display names.
    Note: The password does not enhance security but makes your ID distinct.

4. Establishing a Connection

    Share your complete User ID with the other user, who should also be ready with their own ID.
    One user must enter the other user's ID, and a connection attempt will be made.
